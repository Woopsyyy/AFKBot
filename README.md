## Prerequisites üìã

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git**: Version control system. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). (Recommended: LTS version)
- **GitHub Account**: Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.
- **Code Editor**: Like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for editing files.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To get a copy of the repository on your local machine:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project (e.g., `cd Desktop/Projects`).
3. Run the following command to clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AfkBot.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username where the repo is hosted.

4. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd AfkBot
   ```

### Step 2: Verify the Clone

Check if everything is set up correctly:

```bash
git status
```

You should see something like: `On branch main` and `nothing to commit, working tree clean`.

## Setting Up the Project ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all the required packages like `discord.js`, `mineflayer`, etc.

2. (Optional) Configure settings: Check `settings.json` for any configuration options.

## Making Edits ‚úèÔ∏è

1. Open the project in your code editor (e.g., VS Code):

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. Make your changes to the files (e.g., edit `index.js`, `settings.json`, etc.).

3. Test your changes locally if possible (e.g., run the bot with `node index.js`).

## Committing and Pushing Changes II Updating the repoüì§

Once you've made edits, follow these steps to upload them to GitHub:

1. Check the status of your changes:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This shows which files have been modified.

2. Add your changes to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   Or add specific files: `git add index.js`

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: [brief description of changes]"
   ```

4. Push your changes to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   If it's your first push, you might need to set the upstream branch:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Fetching the Latest Changes üì•

To get the latest updates from the repository:

1. Fetch the latest changes:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Merge the changes into your local branch:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

   Or, if you prefer to merge manually:

   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   ```

If there are conflicts, resolve them in your editor and commit the resolution.

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

- **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have push access to the repository. If not, ask the owner to add you as a collaborator.
- **Merge Conflicts**: Edit the conflicting files, choose the desired changes, and commit.
- **Node Modules Issues**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again.
- **Git Errors**: Check your Git configuration with `git config --list`.

## Contributing ü§ù

Feel free to contribute! Follow the steps above for making changes. If you have questions, reach out to the repo owner.

Happy coding! üéâ
