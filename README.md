   ```bash
   cd AfkBot
   ```

### Step 2: Verify the Clone

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### General Issues:
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure you have push access to the repository. If not, ask the owner to add you as a collaborator.
- **Merge Conflicts**: Edit the conflicting files, choose the desired changes, and commit.
- **Node Modules Issues**: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again.
- **Git Errors**: Check your Git configuration with `git config --list`.

### Branch-Specific Issues:

- **Wrong Branch**: If you're on the wrong branch, use `git checkout jaypee-update` or `git checkout main`
- **Branch Not Tracking Remote**: Use `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/jaypee-update jaypee-update`
- **Outdated Branch**: Always run `git fetch origin` before pulling changes
- **Merge Conflicts Between Branches**: Resolve conflicts manually and commit the resolution
- **Can't Push to Branch**: Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch: `git push origin jaypee-update`
